## :information_source: What's this project?

This project is a reprodution of an application that I developed on the NLW bootcamp of Rocketseat. On the first time, this application was developed using React Native, so, I reproduced the same application using Flutter.

## ðŸ’» Project

Ecoleta is a project developed based on international environment week. 
That aims to connect people to companies that collect specific waste such as light bulbs, batteries, cooking oil, etc.

## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- Flutter
- Dart

## ðŸ”– Layout

To access the previous application (server, web and app) [click here](https://github.com/index325/nlw1_projeto).

## :information_source: What you need to run this app

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) installed on your computer.

After that, run:
```bash
$ flutter doctor
```
That will provide to you informations of what you need to install or update on your computer to start using Flutter.

So, when you finish, open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the Flutter extention. When it's done, you're good to go with Flutter and this application! ðŸ˜œ
